# **App Name**: PowerUp Blocks

## Core Features:

- Numerical Input: Accept numerical input from the user to create new blocks.
- Block Creation and Display: Create a draggable block on the canvas representing the entered number. 
- Factor Division: Split a block into two factors upon a simple click, if the number is composite. Prime numbers cannot be factored.
- Same Value Combination (Power): Create a new block representing the power (e.g., 3² = 9) when two blocks with the same value are dragged and dropped onto each other.
- Different Value Combination (Multiplication): Create a new block representing the product (e.g., 3×5 = 15) when two blocks with different values are dragged and dropped onto each other.
- Contextual Instruction Tool: Provide contextual instructions and feedback during block manipulations using a tool, enhancing user understanding of operations performed.
- Visual Feedback System: Provide automated and visual feedback after mathematical operations for teaching.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep sky blue (#3399FF) for an intellectual and engaging feel.
- Background color: Light cyan (#E5F5FF), providing a light and unobtrusive background.
- Accent color: Bright orange (#FF9933) to highlight interactive elements and results, making them pop.
- Font: 'Inter' sans-serif font; clean and modern for readability, to be used for both the interface and within the blocks.
- Use clear, geometric icons for UI elements like the input button and instructions.
- Spacious canvas layout to allow easy block manipulation.
- Subtle animations for block transformations to visually explain the mathematical operations.
